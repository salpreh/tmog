# The Mirror of Galadriel!
## Episode #004 - Merge Two Sorted Lists

Welcome to ***The Mirror of Galadriel***, one of the activities that will follow in the *The Fellowship of Code*. If you haven't been here before, this is a place where programming problems of different types will be proposed to be solved as fast as possible.

Without further ado, we leave you with the next problem. 

Good luck adventurers!

## Statement

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.

Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

***Constraints***
> - The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
> - -100 <= Node.val <= 100
> - Both `list1` and `list2` are sorted in non-decreasing order.

## Examples

*Example 1*
> **Input**: `list1` = [1,2,4], `list2` = [1,3,4]
> </br> **Output**: [1,1,2,3,4,4]

*Example 2*
> **Input**: `list1` = [], `list2` = []
> </br> **Output**: []

*Example 3:*
> **Input**: `list1` = [], `list2` = [0]
> </br> **Output**: [0]

## Extra

Run, you fools! No extra spicy stuff this time.
