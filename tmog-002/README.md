# The Mirror of Galadriel!
## Episode #002 - Valid Parentheses

Welcome to ***The Mirror of Galadriel***, one of the activities that will follow in the *The Fellowship of Code*. If you haven't been here before, this is a place where programming problems of different types will be proposed to be solved as fast as possible.

Without further ado, we leave you with the next problem. 

Good luck adventurers!

## Statement

Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

    Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
    Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
    Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

***Constraints***
> - 1 <= s.length <= 10^4 
> - s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.

## Examples

*Example 1*
> **Input**: s = "()"
> </br> **Output**: true

*Example 2*
> **Input**: s = "()[]{}"
> </br> **Output**: true

*Example 3:*
> **Input**: s = "(]"
> </br> **Output**: false

## Extra

Run, you fools! No extra spicy stuff this time.
