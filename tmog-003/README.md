# The Mirror of Galadriel!
## Episode #003 - Maximum Subarray

Welcome to ***The Mirror of Galadriel***, one of the activities that will follow in the *The Fellowship of Code*. If you haven't been here before, this is a place where programming problems of different types will be proposed to be solved as fast as possible.

Without further ado, we leave you with the next problem. 

Good luck adventurers!

## Statement

Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.

***Constraints***
> - 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
> - -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4

## Examples

*Example 1*
> **Input**: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
> </br> **Output**: 6
> </br> **Explanation**: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6.

*Example 2*
> **Input**: nums = [1]
> </br> **Output**: 1
> </br> **Explanation**: The subarray [1] has the largest sum 1.

*Example 3:*
> **Input**: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
> </br> **Output**: 23
> </br> **Explanation**: The subarray [5,4,-1,7,8] has the largest sum 23.

## Extra
Here you can find the spice if you want to show off, with a slightly more difficult challenge.
- If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.
