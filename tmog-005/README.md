# The Mirror of Galadriel!
## Episode #005 - Min Stack

Welcome to ***The Mirror of Galadriel***, one of the activities that will follow in the *The Fellowship of Code*. If you haven't been here before, this is a place where programming problems of different types will be proposed to be solved as fast as possible.

Without further ado, we leave you with the next problem. 

Good luck adventurers!

## Statement

Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

Implement the ***MinStack*** class:

- `MinStack()` initializes the stack object.
- `void push(int val)` pushes the element `val` onto the stack.
- `void pop()` removes the element on the top of the stack.
- `int top()` gets the top element of the stack.
- `int getMin()` retrieves the minimum element in the stack.

**You must implement a solution with `O(1)` time complexity for each function.**

***Constraints***

> - -2^31 <= val <= 2^31 - 1
> - Methods pop, top and getMin operations will always be called on non-empty stacks.
> - At most 3 * 10^4 calls will be made to push, pop, top, and getMin.

## Examples

*Example 1*
> **Input**:
>- MinStack minStack = new MinStack();
>- minStack.push(-2);
>- minStack.push(0);
>- minStack.push(-3);
>- minStack.getMin();
>- minStack.pop();
>- minStack.top();
>- minStack.getMin();

> **Output**:
>- (getMin) -3
>- (top) 0
>- (getMin) -2


## Extra

Run, you fools! No extra spicy stuff this time.
