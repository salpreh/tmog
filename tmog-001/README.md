# The Mirror of Galadriel!
## Episode #001 - Two Sum

Welcome to ***The Mirror of Galadriel***, one of the activities that will follow in the *The Fellowship of Code*. If you haven't been here before, this is a place where programming problems of different types will be proposed to be solved as fast as possible.

Without further ado, we leave you with the next problem. 

Good luck adventurers!

## Statement

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. 
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

***Constraints***
> 2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
> </br> -109 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
> </br> -109 <= target <= 10^9
> </br> Only one valid answer exists.

## Examples

*Example 1*
> **Input**: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
> </br> **Output**: [0,1]
> </br> Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

*Example 2*
> **Input**: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
> </br> **Output**: [1,2]

*Example 3:*
> **Input**: nums = [3,3], target = 6
> </br> **Output**: [0,1]

## Extra

Here you can find ***the spice*** if you want to show off, with a slightly more difficult challenge.

- Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n^2) time complexity?
